    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "(Quantitative) finance can be boiled down to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{t+1} = f(\\vec{p}, \\mathbf{X})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to predict the price (or return) of something at some time in the future ($t+1$), using past prices ($\\vec{p}$), and other features ($\\mathbf{X}$). Another formulation would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{t} = e^{-r{n}}\\mathbb{E}[p_{t + n}] \\rightarrow \\tilde{p}_{t} = e^{-rn}f(\\vec{p}, \\mathbf{X})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the price of any asset *now*, is equal to the discounted expected value of that asset at some point in the future ($t+n$). Some examples of this (and don't worry if you don't know what they mean):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Option prices: Black-Scholes is *exactly* the discounted expected payoff of an option at expiry (under the risk-neutral measure).\n",
    "- Bonds: A bond price is equal to the discounted coupon plus principal at maturity.\n",
    "- M&A Deals, VC, PE: A deal price should be equal to the discounted expected cashflows (DCF model).\n",
    "\n",
    "So really these are two sides of the same coin: if I have some prediction (expectation) of prices at time $t+n$, I can back-out what the current price should be at time $t$. If there is a discrepancy between my price and what the market price is, I can put on a profitable trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful concept is *risk* (variance/volatility). One way to think about risk is uncertainty around our prediction. This series of 4 reviews is going to cover techniques we can use for both of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{t+1} = f(\\vec{p}, \\mathbf{X}) \\pm \\epsilon\n",
    "$$"
